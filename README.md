This timeline (https://richardnaar.github.io/EEG100-timeline/) accompanies a paper marking the 100th anniversary of human EEG measurements (Mushtaq et al., 2024). Events depicted from the year 2024 onward represent predictions from over 500 EEG researchers and enthusiasts. The length of each event corresponds to the 95% confidence interval of these predictions. The color of the event varies from red to blue, with red indicating fewer responses and blue indicating more responses for each topic (see the legend in the upper right corner of the timeline).
